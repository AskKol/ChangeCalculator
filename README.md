# ChangeCalculator
A basic application that works out the change to give based on the inputs provided.

##Running the application
1. Clone the repository in which the application sits, preferably using the [Main]( https://github.com/AskKol/ChangeCalculator) branch.

2. After cloning the repository ensure your local machine has .netcore 3.1 installed, if not you can get a copy by clicking [here]( https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1)

3. Open the solution using your preferred IDE that can run .sln projects. I strongly recommend Visual Studio 2019.
The solution can be found in folder named ChangeCalculator in what ever location you cloned the repository to.

4. Once opened in your preferred IDE, run it as per the directive of your IDE. For visual studio that would be pressing F5 to run in debug mode or hold down Control and press F5 to run in non-debug mode.

Thank you for checking out the application, I hope you enjoy it.
